  <h1> CONTEXT </h1>
		<p><i>Rumble Bumble, a Beevon adventure</i> is a tiny collecting game created by Janine Recio and Elena Tchijakoff in two days during Gamerella 2019. It stars Beevon, a hipster bee with a swanky mustache and fancy glasses.</p>
		
    <h1> SETUP </h1>
		<p> The game requires an alternative controller to play. It consists of a Squishable brand bee plush and an Iphone strapped underneath. This all holds together precariously with the help of a rubber band. The game uses the accelerometer inside the phone the control Beevon's movements in game.</p>
